# loco_simulation
Run setup.m to open up simulink model and generate variables.
Other .m files are for visualization, ported from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54852-simple-2d-kinematic-vehicle-steering-model-and-animation.

bicycle_drift_model_original follows strictly to the Stanford model, which assume small sliding angle (<30 degree)
bicycle_drift_model_accurate uses no approximation, should be more accurate under large sliding angle
bicycle_drift_model_modified uses different state definition [Uy r Ux], in order to get rid off division by zero. Not working properly.
